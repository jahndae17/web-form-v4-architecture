# Web Form v4 - Component-Based Architecture

A sophisticated web form application built with a modular handler architecture and comprehensive context management system.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements a clean separation of concerns through specialized handlers:

- **IO Handler** - Captures all user input events (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- **Interface Handler** - Manages component interactions and state
- **Event Handler** - Enforces singleton locks and prevents conflicting operations
- **ChangeLog System** - Coordinates communication between handlers

## 🎯 Key Features

### Handler Chain Architecture
```
User Input → IO Handler → Interface Handler → Event Handler
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Captures      Detects        Applies       Prevents
   Events      Components      Locks        Conflicts
```

### Context Management
- **Comprehensive state tracking** - Mouse, keyboard, component states
- **Real-time synchronization** - All handlers stay informed of changes  
- **Conflict prevention** - Singleton locks prevent simultaneous operations
- **Performance monitoring** - Track system performance and optimization

### Component System
- **Reactive components** - Declare capabilities, don't handle events directly
- **Behavior separation** - Logic separated from presentation
- **Schema-driven** - Components register functions and triggers with event system

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd web-form-v4
   ```

2. **Open index.html** in a modern browser

3. **Development workflow**
   - Components declare their capabilities in `Behavior.js` files
   - Event Handler automatically wires up user inputs to component functions
   - No direct event listeners in components - all handled centrally

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Creating New Components
1. Extend `BaseContainer` class
2. Create separate `Behavior.js` file for interactions
3. Register capabilities with event handler schema
4. Let handlers manage all user input events

### Handler Responsibilities
- **IO Handler**: Raw input capture only
- **Interface Handler**: Component state management
- **Event Handler**: Operation coordination and conflict prevention

## 🔧 Current Status

- ✅ Core handler architecture implemented
- ✅ Context management system active
- ✅ Component base class with comprehensive properties
- ✅ Inter-handler communication via changelog
- ⚠️ ~75% of context properties need handlers (see context_coverage_analysis.md)
- 🚧 Additional managers needed (Selection, Performance, State, etc.)

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

Current handler coverage of context properties:
- **Fully Covered**: 26% (Input tracking, component interaction, locks)
- **Partially Covered**: 26% (Basic operations, modal states)
- **Not Covered**: 47% (Selection, performance, validation, animations)

See `App/Context/context_coverage_analysis.md` for detailed breakdown.

## 🎮 Handler Communication

All handlers communicate through a shared context system:
- Real-time change detection via polling
- JSON-based changelog for inter-handler messages
- Conflict resolution through priority-based locking
- Automatic cleanup and retention policies

## 🧩 Component Philosophy

**"Components are REACTIVE, not PROACTIVE"**

Components declare what they *can* do, and the Event Handler decides *when* to do it. This creates:
- Consistent user experience
- Conflict-free operations  
- Centralized coordination
- Reusable components
